COVID-19 Mortality Analysis and Prediction
📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes and predicts COVID-19 mortality trends using publicly available U.S. COVID-19 datasets. The goal is to understand how mortality varies across age groups, gender, states, and time periods, and to build predictive insights based on historical data.

The project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics and machine learning workflow, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, visualization, and basic predictive modeling.

🎯 Objectives

Analyze COVID-19 death trends over time

Identify high-risk age groups and demographic patterns

Compare mortality across U.S. states

Visualize key insights using charts and graphs

Predict mortality trends using historical data
